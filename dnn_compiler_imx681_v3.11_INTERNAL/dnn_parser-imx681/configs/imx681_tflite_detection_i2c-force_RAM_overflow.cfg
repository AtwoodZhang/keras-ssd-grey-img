# Output mode that selects generated file types:
#   rom - output auto-generated C source (.c\.h) and dnn memory image (.bin)
#         (intended for model that is compiled into firmware as ROM model)
#   i2c - output i2c sequence to load this model on a real sensor via i2c (.bin)
#         Also for simulation.

# Optimization best effort. 
# This is an optional parameter defaulting to false
#
# 1X1_OPTIMIZED convolutions trade RAM usage for execution speed. In the 
# case where the model doesn't fit with these optimizations enabled but
# does fit without them, it can take a long time to find an optimal
# combination of optimizations. This parameter controls the DNN compiler's
# response to this specific situation. 
#
# When "true" the compiler will find a best fit at the expense of 
# compilation time. When "false" the compiler will accept a non-optimzied
# solution that runs slower in the hardware.
OPTIMIZATION_1X1_BEST_EFFORT    true

# Preallocate just enough BMC_RAM to force the model to generate non-flattened 
# buffer for some CONV_2D and ADDSUB routines.
# This is optional and will only work when DNN_COMPILER_INTERNAL_USE is 
# set True

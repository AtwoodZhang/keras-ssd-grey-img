There are 2 methods to load DNN reconfigurable data.
- Method 1. Using memory.bin data (more flexible method)
- Method 2. Using load_sequence_i2C.bin data (simpler method)

Def file for each method can be generated by either one of the following steps.
Method 1. Generate Def file using memory.bin data
   (1) Update dnn_reconf_param.def as specified in "REGISTER SETTINGS" in <reconf_name>_summary.txt file 
   (2) Edit DNN_memory_bin2def.bat file as below
        perl DNN_memory_bin2def.pl <reconf_name>_dnn_memory.bin <start address>
        perl DNN_memory_bin2def.pl <reconf_name>_system_memory.bin <start address>
        type dnn_reconf_param.def <reconf_name>_dnn_memory.def <reconf_name>_system_memory.def > memory_load_sequence.def
   (3) double click DNN_memory_bin2def.bat 
   -> memory_load_sequence.def will be generated

Method 2. Generate Def file load_sequence_i2C.bin data
   (1) Edit DNN_load_sequence_bin2def.bat file
         perl DNN_load_sequence_bin2def.pl <reconf_name>_load_sequence_i2c.bin
   (2) double click DNN_load_sequence_bin2def.bat 
   -> <reconf_name>_load_sequence_i2c.def will be generated

<reconf_name> : reconfigurable DNN name
<start address> : memory start address that specified in <reconf_name>_summary.txt file

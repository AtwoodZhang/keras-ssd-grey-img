# Name

## SSD_ipynb_transfer_callback

# Description

The project was build to explore the DNN tensorflow model building in IMX681.

SSD_ipynb_transfer_callback
 |-- Anchors.py     # to get the anchor;
 |-- callbacks.py   # evaluation part; 
 |-- Datasets.py    # Datasets, Dataloader;
 |-- get_anchors_no_normal.py    # get anchors according to Anchors.py, it will generate a anchor.txt file.
 |-- loss.py        # class loss between predict and GT;
 |-- Models.py      # build the model of SSD and Mobilenet Structure.
 |-- predict.ipynb  # inference according to the input image and output inferred image and bounding box. (write the predict script through jupyter)
 |-- predict.py     # inference according to the input image and output inferred image and bounding box. (write the predict script through py file)
 |-- SSD_Mobile_Det_good.ipynb  # Main function, you can train the project through this script.
 |-- ssd_pred.py    # the function used by predict.py, belongs to the part of the process of predict.
 |-- train.py       # same as SSD_Mobile_Det_good.ipynb, train script.
 |-- utils_bbox.py  # the function used by predict.py, belongs to the part of the process of predict.
 |-- utils_map.py   # mAP 
 |-- utils.py       # functions.

# Installation

pip install -r requirements.txt

# Usage

    * train:
    run SSD_Mobile_Det_good.ipynb, the output windows will shows following information. it is the same as train.py

        class_names: ['good'] num_classes: 2
        type: <class 'numpy.ndarray'> shape: (1242, 4)
        Train on 1603 samples, val on 179 samples, with batch size 32.

    * predict
    run predict.ipynb

    # get anchors.txt, same format as IMX681 requreiment.
